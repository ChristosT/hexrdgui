# First, make sure python3.8+ is installed.
# If it is not, run the following command:

# On OSX you will need to use the Python package from the HEXRD channel
# See the following issue for more details: https://github.com/HEXRD/hexrdgui/issues/505
conda install -c HEXRD python=3.8.4
# Install deps using conda package
conda install -c HEXRD -c cjh1 -c anaconda -c conda-forge hexrdgui
# Now using pip to link repo's into environment for development
pip install --no-deps -U -e hexrd
CONDA_BUILD=1 pip install --no-deps -U -e hexrdgui
```
